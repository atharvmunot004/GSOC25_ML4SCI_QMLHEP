# Task II: Classical Graph Neural Network (GNN) 
## For Task II, you will use ParticleNetâ€™s data for Quark/Gluon jet classification available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/3164691#.YigdGt9MHrB) with its corresponding description. 
<ul>
    <li> Choose 2 Graph-based architectures of your choice to classify jets as being quarks or gluons. Provide a description on what considerations you have taken to project this point-cloud dataset to a set of interconnected nodes and edges.
    <li> Discuss the resulting performance of the 2 chosen architectures.
