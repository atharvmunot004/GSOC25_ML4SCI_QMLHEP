# Task IX: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Implement a classical Kolmogorov-Arnold Network using basis-splines or some other KAN architecture and apply it to MNIST. Show its performance on the test data. Comment on potential ideas to extend this classical KAN architecture to a quantum KAN and sketch out the architecture in detail.
