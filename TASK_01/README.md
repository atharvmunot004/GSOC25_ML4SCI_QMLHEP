# Task I: Quantum Computing Part 
## 1. Implement a simple quantum operation with Cirq or Pennylane
<ol> 
    <li> With 5 qubits 
    <li> Apply Hadamard operation on every qubit 
    <li> Apply CNOT operation on (0, 1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) 
    <li> SWAP (0, 4) 
    <li> Rotate X with pi/2 on any qubit 
    <li> Plot the circuit 
</ol>
<hr>

## 2. Implement a second circuit with a framework of your choice:
<ol>
    <li> Apply a Hadmard gate to the first qubit
    <li> Rotate the second qubit by pi/3 around X
    <li> Apply Hadamard gate to the third and fourth qubit
    <li> Perform a swap test between the states of the first and second qubit |q1 q2> and the third and fourth qubit |q3 q4>
</ol>
