    "Rather than being confined to the conventional 1s and 0s, quantum computers explore possibilities beyond this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a long time, I was curious about how we could evolve beyond our reliance on traditional binary systems and move toward something more advanced. Quantum computing provided that answer in a neat way: superpositions of 1s and 0s.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used to wonder if we would ever develop ternary circuits to pave the way for computations beyond binary logic. However, with the advent of quantum computation, I have realized that there is much more to harness from the world of binary—specifically, the power of superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even while adhering to binary logic, we are pushing new frontiers by exploiting quantum phenomena. Thus, I believe the answer I have been searching for lies in this new domain of computation. I am more than grateful for the opportunity to study and learn its intricacies.\n",

    "Qubits ( a|0⟩ + b|1⟩ ) gives quantum computers the ability to solve problems exponentially faster than classical computers, especially for stuff like factorization (a prominent example being Shor’s algorithm) and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the whole field is still in its early stages—error rates are super high, qubits need to be kept at near absolute zero, and scaling up is a massive challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem of fault tolerance and stable qubits is solved, we will be looking at a whole new revoloution of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we are in the early stages of this technology, I absolutely look forward to the work which we are ought to witness in the disciples of physics, chemisty and computer architecture."
